Here's some short dot files I've made for iSH in the theme of portal, feel free to modified it.

There is 4 different files , that's not a lot !
There is .profile and .bashrc who are made for the look of the shell, and there is the neofetch part who is made for neofetch (pretty self explanatory).
To install these on Alpine just do :
```
apk install git bash neofetch
git clone https://thelink
cd Dot-files
mv -f .profile ~/
mv -f .bashrc ~/
mv -f neofetch ~/.config/
```
